### Donation 

If you guys have enjoyed with me, you are able to donate USDT via [MugglePay 麻瓜宝TG支付钱包](https://telegram.me/MugglePayBot?start=8J9V8DCJ "麻瓜宝用户钱包") 

For example, if you have Binance (or any other exchange like Huobi), you can withdraw 1 USDT to MugglePay, and buy me **a cup of coffee**( I wonder that can 1 USDT afford it? ) by sending the message below to [@MugglePayBot](http://t.me/MugglePayBot):

`/pay @ColetteContreras 1 USDT`
